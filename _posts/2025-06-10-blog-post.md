EEG is not personal data. Today I am reviewing an article titled **I Tried These Brain-Tracking Headphones That Claim to Improve Focus** by Emily Mullen, because I am interested in BCI devices. The device in question is a pair of headphones made by the company *Neurable* called the MW75 Neuro aimed to read EEG signals and improve focus.


Review
====
The article describes Neurable's MW75 Neuro as an everyday brain-computer interface that aims to boost my productivity(!). I think its being tested and available for preorder for $699

(Ohh she mentions that Apple filed a patent for EEG sensors!)

They describe the thing as using eeg sensor to measure and detect what it calls focusing periods. High, medium or low periods. You can earn points when your focus for a while and at the very least be mindful of when you are most attentive and when you are distractable. However, the headset does not seem to be really revolutionary in my eyes as it does not have good contact with the skin and is succeptible to movement (like most eeg sensors). The device also doesn't claim to be a health device, avoiding the need to go through rigorous health testing protocols that a medical device goes through. Still, its function seems to be more similar to a fitbit tracker

> Still, brainwave data is highly personal, and devices like Neurable’s raise questions about how user data is stored and protected.

This quote from the author is understandably reasonable, but slightly misleading. It perpetrates that brainwave data (at least in its current state), is anywhere close to identifiable. Though it can seem very invasive(after all its *your* mind), but still, the amount of EEG data that can be recorded is massive without an equally impressive storage component, and the device (as later mentioned in the article), transforms the raw signal on the spot to a much smaller signal that is translated to focused or not, and some extra details like how long you maintained focus, and accumulated points. It doesn't tell you what you were focusing on just that you do, focus- sometimes during the day. Something that everyone does. But furthermore, if you are already telling the device you are planning on working as the intended use case of the app needs to be explicitly told your transformed brain data isn't going to relay to the app any new information that you weren't going to relay even without the eeg device. 

TLDR: it cant read your mind, and the closest gadgets iIm aware of that can are all invasive and necesarry for clinical application. On the consumer level it can only judge your brain state based off the calculations it computes.

I admittedly did not read the next part of this article where  she references Jennifer Chandler a professor of law at the University of Ottawa wo says that personal health data can be used in ways that aren't obvious.

This is true. For all recording mediums of any kind it is true.

>“If someone is continuously using a device like this, there’s going to be a stream of neurophysiological data that could be available for interpretation,” Chandler says. She points to a [case in Ohio](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1365712720930600) in which data from a man’s pacemaker was used to charge him on two felonies of aggravated arson and insurance fraud after a fire at his home in 2016.

>Chandler can imagine a scenario in which someone is wearing EEG earbuds while driving a car and gets in an accident. If brain data from that device showed that the person wasn’t alert and focused, they could be at fault. While Chandler acknowledges the helpful insights a brain-reading device could provide—she wears a fitness tracker—she says consumers should consider how that data could potentially be used against them.

For the pacemaker setting, yes a device that can reliably give you true and consistently accurate information. An EEG earbud, that isn't consistently reliable cannot prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that a crime is committed, Also it would have to be calibrated to the intended use case of driving which is what metric of neural data can be used to determine a necessary amount of focus for one to drive a car. Now if we had full on mind readers as devices that can tell every thought in your head and it sees your attention dip and focus on something internal in your head...there is an argument for that. But alas, we aren't there yet.
