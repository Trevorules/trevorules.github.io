About Me
======

I am a 6th year PhD candidate in the Neurobiology department at Duke University specializing in computational neuroscience and more broadly neural engineering. I am a senior member of the [Pearson Lab](https://pearsonlab.github.io), lead by Dr. John Pearson, where collectively we build software tools for neuroscience applications. My project focuses on building a real-time tool for detecting latent patterns for oscillatory neural data. 



Interests
------
Beyond neural tool development, I am also interested in brain-computer interfaces, scientific policy, teaching/mentoring and entrepreneurship

I have 8 years of tutoring and teaching experience in math, chemistry, physics, the sciences, and SAT/ACT prep. If you are interested, send me an email [here](mailto:tja.tutoring@gmail.com).


I am a senior PHD graduate student at Duke University. I hold two Biomedical Engineering Degrees; received my BS degree from Rutgers and my MS degree from Northwestern. During my day-to-day, I do research and development research in the space of neuroengineering, computational neuroscience, and brain-related technologies. 

Outside of my work, I  like to  hanging out with friends, playing games, and watching TV.

I have always enjoyed teaching. I have TA'd and lectured courses in college and have tutored for many years thereafter. Broadly speaking,  I have tutored kids in a wide plethora of math/science related courses (see below) from high school to college aged and am confident in my ability to educate and help students grow, learn, and excel to their highest potential. 

SPECIALIZATIONS: CC Math 1 through BC Calculus, Biology, Chemistry, AP Physics, ACT/SAT Math/Science, Calc 2 and 3, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Statics,Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Intro to Python, etc.

Objectives
======
1. Publish and post my tool online, 

2. Defend My Thesis

3. Get Hired for potential academic/industrial positions
