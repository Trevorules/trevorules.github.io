About Me
======

I am a 6th year PhD candidate in the Neurobiology department at Duke University specializing in computational neuroscience and more broadly neural engineering. I am a senior member of the [Pearson Lab](https://pearsonlab.github.io), lead by Dr. John Pearson, where collectively we build software tools for neuroscience applications. My project focuses on building a real-time tool for detecting latent patterns for oscillatory neural data. 



Interests
------
Beyond neural tool development, I am also interested in brain-computer interfaces, scientific policy, teaching/mentoring and entrepreneurship

I have 8 years of tutoring and teaching experience in math, chemistry, physics, the sciences, and SAT/ACT prep. If you are interested, send me an email [here].(mailto:tja.tutoring@gmail.com)


Objectives
======
1. Publish and post my tool online, 

2. Defend My Thesis

3. Get Hired for potential academic/industrial positions
